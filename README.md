## Story of upshot

While we are in collage we have to make our major project, while everyone was building something else and try to solve world problems, we choose to solve the problem around us first. My Best friend Piyush Jain who is the head of Chess Sports department, found a problem that students have to go to bulliten board or ask others in order to know about the events helding in collage, and many times they are not able to participate in the event even if they wanted to.

And we decided to solve this problem. We decided to make a project using which all the orginazers can put the event details and students and teachers(non organizers) or normal users can come to this website and look at the events.


## Features of Upshot - 
Upshot uses new Next13 in frontend to make the UI looks minimal and very new genz look.
In upshot there are three types of users - 
### Students.
### Organizers.
### Admin.


Admin are only 4 - Piyush Jain, Pawan Birla, Shashank Mishra, Priyansh Sharma.
We can do anything in this app from deleting any user who invalid the policies to update the details.

Organizers can post a event, update there events, delete there events. and odcource looks at others events too.
